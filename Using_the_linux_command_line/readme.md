# Defining the command line
> The command line is a tool that provides a text mode interface between the user and the operating system. The command line allows the user to type commands into the computer for processing and to see the results.

The Linux command-line interface is implemented with shells such as Bash (Bourne
again shell), csh (C shell), and ksh (Korn shell) to name just three of the many that are
available. The function of any shell is to interpret commands typed by the user and pass
the results to the operating system which executes the commands and returns the results
to the shell.
